            <p>The largest and longest running academically rigorous research program on software delivery & operations. 
            DORA was founded by Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim. DORA joined Google Cloud in 2018.</p>

            The DORA research shows that velocity and stability do not have to be tradeoffs. The Four Key Metrics can be used to measure 
            software delivery and operations:
            <ul>
              <li>Deployment Frequency - The number of times code is deployed to production each day, week, or month.</li>
              <li>Lead Time for Changes - The time it takes to make a change to production.</li>
              <li>Time to Resolution - The time it takes to resolve an issue in production.</li>
              <li>Change Failure Rate - The percentage of changes that fail in production.</li>
            </ul>
            The four key metrics can be used to track the progress of a team over time and to identify areas where improvement is needed.

            How do we get better?  DORA's research includes a predictive analysis of which capabilities drive the outcomes teams want.
            This predictive analysis gives us key insights into where to invest.  
           
            <p>By tracking the DORA four keys, teams can identify areas where they can improve their velocity and stability. This can lead to a more efficient and 
            reliable software delivery process.</p>
